in a world full of Light Mode themes that are just white, here is a tea stained one to enjoy. 



🗺️ MapQuest
A vintage color scheme inspired by paper maps and the golden era of cartography.

🚗 The Journey Begins
MapQuest is an IDE and editor theme that evokes the distinct, slightly worn aesthetic of the paper maps we used to rely on for every adventure. It’s a tribute to the era before GPS, where folding maps and tracing routes with a finger were essential to navigation.

This theme transforms your digital workspace into a cozy, historical artifact, featuring a warm, tea-stained palette and clear, legible "ink" for a look that is both deeply nostalgic and exceptionally easy to read.

🎨 Design & Aesthetic
The Palette: Sepia and Archive Ink
The color palette is meticulously crafted to mimic the physical characteristics of a well-traveled paper map:

Background (The Paper): Features deep, muted tones of sepia, antique parchment, and faint ochre. This provides a comfortable, low-contrast canvas that is easy on the eyes for extended coding sessions.

Foreground (The Ink): Uses rich, dark colors—primarily deep mahogany and charcoal—for standard text, simulating archival ink used for cities and labels.

Syntax (The Routes): Brighter, yet still subdued, colors are reserved for syntax highlighting. These hues, like faded jade, dusty azure, and muted rose, represent the hand-drawn details, highways, and marked routes on an old map. They pop just enough to aid readability without disrupting the overall vintage atmosphere.

Key Features
Low Contrast Comfort: Designed to minimize eye strain while maintaining excellent code readability.

Historical Texture: The overall look evokes a feeling of warmth and history, making your environment feel less like a screen and more like a carefully maintained journal.

Road-Trip Ready: A sophisticated and unique alternative to high-contrast dark or sterile light themes.
